            <h2 class="padding-content">First version</h2>

            <p class="padding-content">
                The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came by developer named <a href="#" target="_blank"rel="external" class="external">Dan Morrill</a>. He says that opened <a href="#" target="_blank"rel="external" class="external">InkScape</a> (free software to vectorizing images) and create his own robot version. The goal was to personify the sistem only for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.

            </picture>

            <p class="padding-content">
                This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: it would be the Dandroids.
            </p>

            <h2 class="padding-content">A new mascot emerges</h2>
            <p class="padding-content">
                The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="external" class="external">Irina Blok</a>, also a <strong>Google</strong> employee, was given the mission to representing the little bot in a more pleasant way.

                <img src="Style/imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok-image/png">
            </picture>

            <p class="padding-content">
                Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with a few lines and that flatter form. The drawing should also generate quick identification with whoever looks at it. That's how <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, Android's new mascot born.

            </picture>

            <p class="padding-content">
                The main inspiration for the new Bugdroid lines came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the type of each door. Legend has it that an artist was creating at his desk in <strong>Google's</strong> office and she looked at the side of the toilets and the identification was immediate: simple, clean and objective.
